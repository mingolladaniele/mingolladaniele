# Hi, I'm Daniele ðŸ‘‹

Data Scientist at [Glovo](https://glovoapp.com/) - one of Europe's fastest-growing tech companies pioneering quick-commerce in 25 countries. Currently leading ML initiatives in the promotions team, building personalization systems to optimize user experience and business value at scale.

I've worked at some of Europe's top tech companies - from optimizing warehouse operations at **Amazon** to developing game systems at **SocialPoint** (Take-Two Interactive) to driving ML initiatives at **Glovo**. Holding an **MSc in Data Science** and **BSc in Computer Science**, I combine strong technical skills with business impact.

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact Highlights

- Deployed ML recommendation systems driving â‚¬4M projected annual GMV impact
- Applied causal inference to validate discount policy impact, detecting a 99.6% fraud reduction without revenue degradation
- Developed temporal graph neural networks at Amazon to model 1,000+ warehouse dependencies
- Automated game balancing for [Top Troops](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=game.socialempiresmerge) using genetic algorithms

## ðŸ’¡ What I Do

I transform complex business problems into scalable ML solutions:

- **ML Systems & Deployment**: Build and scale production ML systems
- **Experimentation**: Design and analyze A/B tests end-to-end, from power analysis to stakeholder communication
- **Deep Learning & AI**: Implement neural networks for complex tasks like temporal predictions
- **Causal Inference**: Apply statistical rigor to validate business decisions and measure true impact

Always up for interesting challenges!
